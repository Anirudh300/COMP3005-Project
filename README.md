Author: Anirudh Bakshi (101158699)


Design Decisions:

The ER-diagram and all the assumptions were made early on as a start. Then the ER-diagram was reduced into Schemas and tests are also done to make sure they are in good normal form.


Files Included:

ReadMe: The ReadMe file with instructions and any information related to the program
book_store.py: Class which executes the command-line application for our bookstore
book_store.sql: All the DDL statement and sql queries are stored in this file
