Author: Anirudh Bakshi (101158699)


Design Decisions:

The ER-diagram and all the assumptions were made early on as a start. Then the ER-diagram was reduced into Schemas and tests are also done to make sure they are in good normal form.


Files Included:

ReadMe: The ReadMe file with instructions and any information related to the program
book_store.py: Class which executes the command-line application for our bookstore
book_store.sql: All the DDL statement and sql queries are stored in this file


Set-up Instructions:

Download the zip file. Open any python IDE and setup a workspace. To open the zip file inside the IDE, from the main menu, click file then select import. Go to General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next. Click the Select Archive File and browse for the zip file that was downloaded in the previous steps. The new project should now be visible in the IDE. Run the book_store.py class to browse the application.


Available Commands:

1. Login as Owner/Customer
2. Register as new user
3. Exit

Using Instructions:

When the code is run, there will be 3 options - to login as a customer or admin, register as a new customer and exit the program. There are 2 interfaces - one for the customer and the other for the admin. Customers can search a book, add to cart, check out and check the status of the order whereas the admin has all the control like to add/remove a book, update the stock and status of a book. All of this can be run with the commands and options like 1 or 2 and so on.
